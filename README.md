## About the project

We used separate web pages as templates and our task was to recreate them using only HTML and CSS. 

## What I learned

We learned first the basics of HTML and CSS, then started to learn more on how to make the site for fluid and responsive using media queries. At the end we were introduce to CSS Grid Flexbox.
